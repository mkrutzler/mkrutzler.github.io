<h1>Why I don't use Social Media (a Rant)</h1>

<p>I don't really think that I need an explanation. It is you who needs to explain, why to use it in the first place.</p>

<p>
However they are still some reasons, which made me to commit to not use one.
Back in the day I used to be a normie, surfing Instagram and YouTube.
(To be honest I still watch some videos on YouTube from time to time).
Initially didn't even think about reasons for quitting except that I waste to much time doing nothing.
Then as time went on I noticed how different other people are.
They were with me physically but it I was still kinda lonely.
I don't know the most recent movies or games.
Still to be honest I don't care.
I also became a really good reader.
I used to hate reading, because I simply didn't have the attention span to do so.
In the books I read the authors were only agreeing with me.
Social media not only destroys your mental health by creating unreal expectations but also shorten your attention span.
</p>

<p>
Now that I stated the benefits of quitting I will try to defend against common arguments for staying on the platform that I had and that I often hear.
<ul>

<li>I can't quit forever, so I might as well just use it: The thing is that you are either slave to god or slave to sin. You are either slave to consistent behaviour or impulses. I don't know about you but I rather have constant control over myself that being just a "chemical reaction".</li>
<li>I need it to stay in contact with people: I assume that you don't use it to stay in contact with close friends. If so then you could also use a dedicated messaging app or even "just" call. If you're 'staying connected' with people that you rarely see and just scroll through their feed for info about their life than I am sorry. Just visit them (irl) if you really care or write them a message once in a while. I am sure that they will be happy to hear from you. If not then you are just a stalker.</li>
<li>I need it to reach my customers (as a side hustler): Well if you are producing such a good product then the customers will come to you. If you have to chase them then I would ask: Do I really create value to the world.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>If you are still reading than I will assume that you are on my side. If you try to quit it will be hard. This is the point, where you realise how addicted you really are. Now my "top three tips for quitting":</p>

<ol>
<li>Delete all of your social media and never look back.</li>
<li>If step one didn't work try it again, because it works and you just didn't commit.</li>
<li>If step two didn't work then I recommend trying step one.</li>
<li>(Honorable Mention): Just do step one</li>
</ol>

<p>Now for real, step one is the only thing you really have to do. Just do it. One real tip is to not only "kill" the habit of scrolling but replace it. You will need to identify the reason why you do it and then find another way to fulfill that craving.</p>
