<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, I am Mark and this is my corner of the internet. I like to fiddle around with computers and technology. I am 17yo and go to 'Kantonschule Im Lee'. I speak English, German and Hungarian.</p>

<p>I like ThinkPads and generally Linux as well. Yes I know it's GNU/Linux but to be honest I don't care. I also go climbing once in a while. My other favorite hobby is reading. I am currently the creator of a bookclub in my school (it's only a few people from my class and invite only). There will be some notes and summaries under the <a href='bookclub.html'>bookclub page</a>.</p>

<p>This website is written in vim as it is (in my opinion) the best editor that exists. With my custom shortcuts for the different html tags and other commands, it is actually fun to write a website. The same goes for latex.</p>



<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>If you have an offer, oppurtinity or introduction that might make my life more interesting feel free to email me. For the reasons stated above, I'll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.
