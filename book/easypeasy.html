<div class="noteText">
    At its core, the message is “The most precious thing on this earth, my last thought and action, will be orgasm.” Is this exaggeration? Watch any TV or movie plot and you’ll see the mix up of the sensory (touch, smell, voice) and the propagative (orgasmic) parts of sex. The impact of this doesn’t register on our conscious, but the subconscious has time to absorb it.

    Constant exposure to a supernormal stimulus rewires your brain, so building a resistance to this brainwashing is critical, as if buying a car from a second hand car dealer—nodding politely but not believing a word the man is saying. So don’t believe that you must have as much sex as you can, all of it being exceptionally good, using porn in its absence.

    Once you become addicted to internet porn, the brainwashing is increased. Your subconscious mind knows the little monster has to be fed, blocking everything else. It’s fear that keeps people from quitting, fear of that empty, insecure feeling they get when they stop flooding their brains with dopamine. Just because you’re unaware of it doesn’t mean it’s not there. You don’t have to understand it any more than a cat needs to understand where the hot water pipes are: the cat just knows that if it sits in a certain spot it feels warm.

    We tend to think of porn as a tug-of-war: on one side is fear, “It’s unhealthy, filthy and enslaving.” On the other side, the positives: “It’s my pleasure, my friend, my crutch.” It never seems to occur to us this side is also fear; it’s not that we enjoy porn, it’s that we tend to be miserable without it. Heroin addicts deprived of heroin go through misery, but picture the utter joy when they’re finally allowed to plunge a needle into their vein and end that terrible craving. Try to imagine how anyone could actually believe they get pleasure from sticking a hypodermic syringe into a vein. Non-heroin addicts don’t suffer that panic feeling and heroin doesn’t relieve the feeling, it causes it.

I assure you of a phenomenal new sexual experience far better than any other, if you ever get that offer. Try it.)

    Get it firmly in your mind that there’s no such thing as ‘just one peek’. It’s a chain reaction that will last the rest of your life unless broken. The myth about the odd, special occasion keeps users moping after stopping. Get into the habit of never seeing the ‘no big deal’ session, it’s fantasy. Whenever you think about porn, see a filthy lifetime of spending eons behind a screen for the privilege of destroying yourself mentally and physically—a lifetime of slavery and hopelessness. It isn’t a crime if your erections are unreliable, but it is when you could be happier long-term but instead choose to sacrifice that for short term ‘pleasure’.

    The reason is that they don’t exist, it’s the doubt and uncertainty that creates pangs. The beautiful truth is that it’s easy to stop porn.

    There are certain essential points necessary to get clear in your mind before you start: Realize you can achieve it. There’s nothing different about you and the only person who can make you watch is yourself. Not that star, never in their wildest dreams having thought about themselves being used for reducing virility. There’s absolutely nothing to give up. On the contrary, there’s enormous positive gains to be made. Not only that you’ll be healthier and richer, but you’ll enjoy the good times more and be less miserable during the bad. There’s no such thing as a peek or a single visit. Pornography is drug addiction and a chain reaction, by moaning about the odd visit you’ll only be needlessly punishing yourself. See porn not as a ‘boys-will-be-boys’ habit that might injure you, but as drug addiction. Face up to the fact that whether you like it or not, you’ve got the disease. It won’t go away because you bury your head in the sand. Remember that like all crippling diseases, it not only lasts for life but gets exponentially worse. The easiest time to cure it is now. Separate the disease—the neurological addiction—from the mindset of being a user or not. All users, if given the opportunity to go back to the time before they became hooked, would jump at the opportunity. You have that opportunity today! Don’t even think about it as ‘giving up’.

    22 The Withdrawal Period

<div class="noteText">
    For up to three weeks after your last session you may be subjected to withdrawal pangs. These consist of two quite separate but distinct factors: Dopamine withdrawal pangs. An empty, insecure feeling similar to hunger, identified as cravings or a ‘something-I-must-do’ feeling. Psychological triggers of certain external stimuli such as commercials, online browsing, telephone conversations, etc.

    The user has gotten into the habit of relieving their withdrawal pangs at certain times and certain occasions, which causes an association of ideas (“ I’ve got a hard on, so I must watch porn.” or “I’m in bed with my laptop and I must have a session to feel happy”).

    Even under EasyPeasy, responding to triggers is the most common failing. The ex-user tends to regard internet porn as a sort of placebo or sugar pill, thinking, “I know porn does nothing for me, but if I think it does then on certain occasions it will be helpful.” A sugar pill, although giving no actual physical help, can be a powerful psychological aid to relieve genuine symptoms and is therefore beneficial.

    It’s quite common at such times, with the best of intentions, to say, “Have one harem visit, it’ll help calm you down.” If the offer is accepted, it won’t have a calming effect as there’s no dopamine addiction and therefore no withdrawal pangs. At best, all it’ll do is give them a momentary psychological boost. Even after the session is over, the original tragedy is there. In fact, it’ll be increased because the person now suffers withdrawal pangs and thus has to make a choice: endure them, or seek relief by repeating the water slide ride to start the chain of misery all over again. All the porn provided was a fleeting psychological boost, the same that could’ve been achieved by a book or feel-good movie, even a bad one. Many non-users and ex-users have become re-addicted as a result of such occasions. Get it quite clear in your mind: you don’t need the dopamine rush and are only torturing yourself further by continuing to regard it as some sort of prop or boost. There’s no need to be miserable.

I’m losing the urge and am not that into the shocking stuff.” In fact, the reverse is the case. Get it clear in your mind, enjoyment of orgasm wasn’t the reason you quit porn. If users were there for orgasm alone, they’d never watch more than one clip.

    If work stresses you out, you think, “At times like this I would’ve had a session.” This is true, but the important thing that’s forgotten is that porn didn’t solve the problem, and you’re simply punishing yourself by moping for illusory crutches. You’re creating an impossible situation, miserable because you can’t masturbate to porn, yet you’ll be even more miserable if you do. You know that you’ve made the correct decision by stopping it, so why punish yourself by doubting your decision?

    While there are many joys in life, it’s impossible to recapture the actual feeling of experiencing them. The joy of not having to watch porn anymore is different, if feeling low and needing a boost, remind yourself of how lovely it is not to be hooked on that awful addiction. Many list it as one of the greatest events of their lives. In most cases, the moment of revelation takes place not after three weeks, but after a few days.

    The key to the problem isn’t waiting for the moment of revelation, but to realize that once you close the browser it’s finished. You’ve cut off the supply of oxygen to your little monster. No force on Earth can prevent you from being free, unless you mope about it or wait for revelation. Go and enjoy life; cope with it right from the start. The moment will soon arrive.

    Remember, the only reason you’ve read this book so far is because you’d dearly love to escape. So make that positive decision now, making a solemn vow that when you close your private browser window, whether finding it easy or difficult, you’ll never visit your harem again. Perhaps you’re worried that you’ve made this vow several times in the past and are still failing, or that you’ll have to go through awful trauma. Have no fear, the worst thing that can possibly happen is that you fail, so therefore you have absolutely nothing to lose and so much to gain.

    All you need to do is follow the simple instructions about to be given. Make the solemn vow now and mean it. Browse the pictures and clips on your favorite tube site consciously, looking at the desperate attempts by the site administrators, actors and even amateurs to amplify the shock, novelty and supernormal nature of their wares and ask yourself where the pleasure is. When you finally close the browser, don’t do so with a feeling of “I must never visit another online harem again” or “I’m not allowed to visit another” but instead with a feeling of freedom, like “Isn’t it great? I’m free! I’m no longer a slave to porn! I don’t ever have to visit these filthy sites in my life again.” Be aware that for a few days, there’ll be a little porn saboteur inside your stomach. You might only be aware of the feeling of wanting a session. The little porn monster has been referred to as the slight physical craving for dopamine. Strictly speaking this is incorrect, and it’s important to understand why. Because it takes up to three weeks for that little monster to die, ex-users believe the little monster will continue to crave after the final online harem visit, and therefore they must use willpower to resist the temptation during this period. This isn’t so, the body doesn’t crave porn-triggered dopamine; only the brain craves.

    If you do get that feeling of wanting a peek over the next few days, your brain has a simple choice. It can either interpret that feeling for what it actually is—an empty, insecure feeling started by the first visit to an online porn site and further perpetuated by each subsequent one, and saying to yourself “YIPPEE! I’M A NON-USER!” Or, you can start craving for porn and suffer for the remainder of your life. Just think for a moment, wouldn’t that be an incredibly stupid thing to do? To say, “I never want to watch porn again” and then spending the rest of your life saying “I’d love a visit”? That’s what those using the willpower method do, and it’s no wonder they feel so miserable. Spending the rest of their lives desperately moping for something they desperately hope they’ll never have. No wonder that so few succeed and the few that do never feel completely free.

    ’Get this mental picture clearly in your mind, for it can be quite helpful in overcoming the power of external stimuli to disturb you. See yourself sitting quietly, letting the phone ring, ignoring its signal, unmoved by its command. Although you are aware of it, you no longer mind or obey it. Also, get clearly in your mind the fact that the outside signal in itself has no power over you, no power to move you. In the past you have obeyed it, responded to it, purely out of habit. You can, if you wish, form a new habit of not responding. ’Also notice that your failure to respond does not consist in doing something, or making an effort, or resisting or fighting, but in doing nothing—in relaxation from doing. You merely relax, ignore the signal, and let its summons go unheeded. The telephone ringing is a symbolic analogy to any and every other outside stimulus you might habitually give control over to and now choose to very intentionally alter that habit.’—Maxwell Maltz, The New Psycho Cybernetics Ch. 12.

    You’ll remain a happy non-user provided: You never doubt your decision. You don’t wait to become a non-user. If you do, you’ll merely be waiting for nothing to happen and creating a phobia. You don’t try not to think about porn or wait for the ‘moment of revelation’ to come, creating a phobia. You don’t use substitutes. You see all the other users as they really are and pity them rather than envying them.

    Fear of failure. There’s no disgrace in failure, but not trying is plain stupidity. Look at it this way, you’re hiding from nothing. The worst thing that can happen is that you fail, in which case you are no worse off than you are now. Just think how wonderful it would be to succeed. If you don’t make the attempt, you’ve already guaranteed failure.

    That empty, insecure feeling is identical to normal hunger, depression or stress. All porn does is increase the level of it. This is why users who stop using the willpower method are never quite sure if they’ve kicked it, even after their body has ceased suffering dopamine withdrawal. If suffering normal hunger or stress, their brain is still telling them this is a valid reason to claim their entitled session. The point being that you don’t have to wait for the craving to go, since it’s so slight that we don’t even know it’s there, only knowing it as a feeling of wanting. When you leave the dentist do you wait for your jaw to stop aching?

    It’s as simple as this, for the next couple of days you’ll have a slight trauma in your life. Your body will suffer the almost imperceptible aggravation of withdrawal from demands and claims for a dopamine surge. Now, bear this in mind: you’re no worse off than you were. This is what you’ve been suffering for the whole of your life, every time you’ve been asleep, in church, the supermarket or library. It didn’t seem to bother you while you were a user and if you don’t stop, you’ll go on suffering this distress for the rest of your life.

    Remember, fear is the pang itself. Giving into a pang generates more fear, feeding the weakened little monster and succeeding in spooking the non-user into thinking they’re hooked for life. In reality, their conceptualization of the brainwashing hasn’t changed, but they’ve given dopamine to the thought process. This is by definition falling forward but is a failure to follow instructions. Understand which one below and rejoice.
