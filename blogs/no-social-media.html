    <h1>Why I don't use (and hate) social media</h1>
    <p>That's a pretty bold statement for a Zoomer. Yet I have my (good) reasons. First of all let me tell you how I got to where I am now and what I've learnt from it. After that section you might be able to relate to many if not all statements/arguments. I'll then humbly present my recommendations and advice for quitting. In that part I will try to give you a deeper look into the problem. Feel free to skip around and read the parts that "smell" the most interesting.</p>
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>Before we start let me make clear that I am neither complaining nor showing off. I hope that you can learn something from my story. I am also extremely privileged, when it comes to the opportunities that I have/had. With that in mind let's start.</p>
    <p>
        My first contact with social media was around age 8 or 9. I didn't really think anything about it and therefore it wasn't really my conscious and rational decision either. I remember that I created my facebook account on the school's library computer. To be honest the only reason why I did it in the first place was peer pressure. Even if I wanted to use it I had to go to the library, because I didn't have a smart phone or computer until much later (a blessing in disguise, which I only realized recently).  Basically I had social media, because why not and at that time there seemed to be no disadvantages to it. As the time went on, the same happened with all other major platforms. If you would have asked me, why I signed up to them I could have said whatever. <i>"Ahm, well, ahm, *really awkward break* I have an instagram, because my dog ate it."</i> (If you have actually good humour unlike me and don't get the joke: It is a reference to the "my dog ate my homework" excuse, which is a really obvious lie.)
    </p>
    <p>
        I admit it that I didn't have many followers back then. To be precise I had one and I was seeing him everyday anyways. During this time of my life the circumstances changed drastically. First I've got a phone. Second we moved to a different country. Through social media I kept contact to my classmates. Or that's what most users would think. In reality it's not really that easy. <br>Let's see it as it is: It's a tool. This is a crucial point. It's not magic and therefore it'll only allow you to stay connected. You need to want it (and the other person as well or it is just stalking). A text messaging app (like Whatsapp) could carry out the same tasks equally if not better.
    </p>
    <p>
        The years passed and my usage increased in small increments. Around 2020, the newest and shiniest app arrived: TikTok. Fortunately I escaped its poisonous claws by a hair's breadth. At home I essentially got bullied into not using TikTok. It's important to note that I used to have Screen-Time and also other restriction on my phone. Then everything changed. Other platforms adapted the short-form format. Notably Youtube and Instagram. This was pretty predictable regarding TikTok's success at sucking out everybody's soul. What was really surprising is the change in the attitude of my family and surroundings to it. It was welcomed and I got quickly dragged into the abyss. The only thing limiting my usage was the restriction on my phone. I had around 1h a day. The biggest problem is that you (probably) weren't disgusted or surprised by 1 hour a day. It might even sound harmless as this is far under the norm (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/">currently around 2h+</a>). From this state it got even worse when my Screen-Time restrictions got removed (age 15/16). The hours just increased every day. This went on for a month or so until the pattern finally changed from a constant usage to a wave-like form. Some days I used a lot and then not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Around &plusmn; a year later my eyes got opened. I happened to be on YouTube and the algorithm was exceptionally on my side. Even though the YouTuber doesn't post anymore (I think) and wasn't active during the time I found him, I was greatly moved by his content and decided to change. If you would stumble upon him, then it would be pretty obvious that I was inspired by him. At this point I got into reading non-fiction books and changed my relationship with technology. I finally fought peer pressure. Though the road wasn't smooth I got where I am now and I am grateful for the events that happened and how it turned out.
    </p>

    <h2>What I've learnt and how you can quit</h2>

    <p>Once again I don't hate technology. I just hate it how it is (ab)used. The next section will (probably) be insulting to many people so I am sorry in advance. I will mostly generalize and many might think that they don't belong to this category. Please if you feel so try to quit for a week to prove it to yourself. (this is where you say, well I don't need to prove it, because I am not in this category and the arguments go on forever...)</p>
    <p>
        One of the most important lessons that I've learnt is that don't do stuff just because others are doing. In one of the books I read there was really good statement:
        <br><em>
            [If you just follow what others do]... hope that your friends don't start cutting their heads off to cure their headaches.
        </em>(Or something similar)<br>
        There is nothing wrong with relying on others. Just please be aware what you're signing up for. Feel free to experiment around and question your believes.
    </p>
    <p>

        Now let me try to defend against the common arguments for staying on the platform that I had and that I often hear. Then I'll list some reasons and underlying problems that I experienced. In the end I'll propose some actionable steps, which you can apply to quit it altogether.
        <ul>
            <li>My personal favorite: "I can't quit forever (fear of failing to quit), so I might as well just use it.": If you don't try then you'll never escape. The (obviously false) mindset that many have is that there are only extremes. Either I am a degenerate or I should move and live under a rock. It is not a boolean problem but rather a spectrum. What I ask you to do is move closer to the non-connected and happy end.</li>
            <li>"I need it to stay in contact with people.": I assume that you don't use it to stay in contact with close friends. For that a messaging service is much better suited (not even mentioning calling or seeing them irl). An other option is that you're "staying connected" with people that you rarely see and just scroll through their feed to catch up to them. I am pretty sure that if you send them a message once in a while, then they'll be happy to tell you more about what's happening in their life. If not, then should you really try to catch up them on social media?</li>
            <li>"I need it to reach my customers (as a business)": This is a fair point, however I still think many that many miss use it (personal opinion incoming). I'm guessing that you will use social media as marketing. This is valid and a good option in our modern world. However if you use it as marketing, why do you spend more time on it than needed. There is nobody standing on the side of real posters and billboards to answer every question immediately. <em>"If you spend your time chasing butterflies, they'll fly away, If you spend your time making a beautiful garden, the butterflies will come to you."</em> Focus on what's important (probably a high quality product or service)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let me get to the benefits of quitting.
        <ul>
            <li>The first obvious one is time. Would like a job that pays the same wage as yours now and get extra three weeks of holiday? Most of us including me say yes. Here are the good news. This job is not that impossible to get as you might think. In fact, there's no need for you to switch jobs at all. The only thing you have to do is hit one (or multiple) red Xs on you phone. By that I mean quitting or more precisely escaping social media. As for the math behind my argument:\[1h*365=365h\\356h/24h=15.2d\] 15 days are three working weeks. In the equation I used one hour for the daily average, which is much less than the average usage worldwide.</li>
            <li>The previous reason is convincing enough, however there is more to it. Even if you happen to find (fake) value in social media, there is a good chance that you could invest that time into something better, that doesn't seem better at the moment. You are therefore not only losing time but an opportunity to "upgrade" your future. Social media is free, because you pay with your time.</li>
            <li>In addition your attention span gets shortened, because of what it is constantly exposed to (short form content of different genres). If you wanted to learn something in the future (and didn't have time sooner because of social media) then it will be even more difficult, which is just an insult to the injury.</li>
            <li>While being a social media user I always felt like that something was missing. This is really logical if you think about it. You are constantly surfing through everybody's idealized life. You own isn't shining constantly (and it shouldn't) like that random persons. Therefore you are jealous and want something that is at least as good as theirs (this can often happen subconsciously).</li>
            <li>As time went on after I quit I noticed how different other people are. They can't wait or be bored. If they are separated from their phones their anxiety spikes. You can't see what's on it, because of "PrIvACy" (and they go on and share all their data with literary every company from silicon valley to china). They tend to be less happy and more ignorant and stressed (in my experience). As for me I used act like this as well. I though of my phone as one of the most important things in the world and no one else was allowed to touch it.</li>
            <li>I don't know the most recent movies, games or trends. Still to be honest I don't care and I don't think that knowing that stuff would make a better or more interesting person. I am glad that I don't know them. </li>
            <li>(If you are interested: There is a video, which I recommend watching even though it goes too far: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZCuAbjdfsg" target="_blank">Link Here.</a> No, this is not the YouTuber I was talking about in my story.)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are still reading than I will assume that you are on my side. Before you try to quit you might expect that it will be hard and you have to give up something. This is not necessary the case, still you'll realize how addicted you really are (The first step of quitting). The problem is that you think that you have to give up something even though you aren't. By this you unconsciously put social media in a good light/identify it as pleasurable. However you can look at anything and create a delusion, in which that object has a use case or provide value (eg.: literary every addiction). The sheer fact, that you don't even know exactly why you signed up should be the evidence that you don't need it (if not enough, then realize that you don't really socialize on the platform and rather just consume content). Eliminate the brainwashing and you are free.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now my "top three tips for quitting":
    </p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Delete all of your social media accounts/apps and never look back.</li>
        <li>If tip one didn't work try it again, because it works and you just didn't commit.</li>
        <li>If tip two somehow still failed you, then try tip one.</li>
    </ol>
    (Honorable Mention): Just do tip one<br>
    Now for real, tip one is the only thing you really have to do. Just do it. One useful advice is to not only "kill" the habit of scrolling but replace it. You will need to identify the reason why you do it and then find another way to fulfill that craving/purpose. For example: <br> "I use social media, so I see, what others are doing." Quit social media and go ahead to do those things with them instead of looking at what they did with jealousy. Sadly reality is often not this simple, however there are multiple ways to socialize. Our grandparents could have friends as well. "I use social media for entertainment". Wait, isn't social media there to socialize? I am sure there are more enjoyable ways to be entertained.
</p>
<p>At this point you'll catch yourself craving. This can be overwhelming. I recommend that you think about how you successfully <b>escaped</b> and didn't give up social media. Also what I noticed what that I instantly grabbed my phone, whenever I had time. Then I opened it craving the instant dopamine (which I used to get from the apps) only to realize that I have quit. At this point you have your phone in your hand unlocked and don't know what to do. Feel free to laugh out yourself and see it as a win: You noticed you old bad behaviors, which were previously done unconsciously.
 The more you become aware of your actions the better you can control them. This seems like common sense, however when talking about adictions and (bad) habits you can (and will) forget that you
 </p>
<p>This post is the first one of the series "Under the Rock", in which I will present a way to live with technology without headaches and mindfog. Feel free to contact me if I left something out. Remember: You don't give it up, you escape it.</p>
