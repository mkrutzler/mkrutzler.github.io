DONE:
    There should be a contact, about and blog directory page.

    Every page should contain the 4 main links: index (home), about, contact and blogs. => put it inside the template. 
    Also template should have the style.css added. => I can change the style by editing one file only.

    Style: find a beige-white background? + not the default font :skull:. It should be minimalist though.

TODO:
the blog directory is a list of all the available blogs. Blogs are in a subdir.
Find out a way how to to query that subdir. Then have sorting algorithms. Maybe a random button.

Also Blackmode?
